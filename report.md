# Machine Learning Algorithms

## Part A - Classification Algorithms

_Two to three pages_

### What you did

Part A of this project was designed to teach about different classification algorithms. For this part, several different classification algorithms were used on the famous Iris data set to predict the species of an Iris given the sepal width, sepal height, petal width, and petal height. This application uses the decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, neural networks through backpropagation, and k-means clustering algorithms. 

### Results

Which classification learning algorithm performed best?

### Lessons Learned

### Digit Data Comparison

## Part B - Gradient Decent

_Two pages_

### What you did

### Results

Compare the training time and final performance of the neural networks trained using these three variants of gradient descent and report your results using at least one graph.

### Analysis

Include a description of the neural network you trained: how many hidden layers and hidden units, how many input and output nodes, and the details of the learning algorithm (learning rate, momentum).
