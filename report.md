# Machine Learning Algorithms

## Part A - Classification Algorithms

_Two to three pages_

### What you did

### Results

### Lessons Learned

### Digit Data Comparison

## Part B - Gradient Decent

_Two pages_

### What you did

### Results

Compare the training time and final performance of the neural networks trained using these three variants of gradient descent and report your results using at least one graph.

### Analysis

Include a description of the neural network you trained: how many hidden layers and hidden units, how many input and output nodes, and the details of the learning algorithm (learning rate, momentum).
