# Machine Learning Algorithms

The goal of this project is to comapre different machine learning algorithms for different problems. Part A of this application focuses on using the Iris dataset to compare classification algorithms. Part B of this project focuses on different implementations of gradient decent.

## Part A - Classification Algorithms

_Two to three pages_

### What you did

Part A of this project was designed to teach about different classification algorithms. Several different classification algorithms were used on the famous Iris dataset to predict the species of an Iris given the sepal width, sepal height, petal width, and petal height. These classification algorithms include the decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, neural networks through backpropagation, and k-means clustering algorithms. These algorithms were implemented through [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html).</br>

This project was developed using [Python 3.7.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) and [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). Additionally, the machine used to build and run the code is running MacOs Mojave (v10.14.6).</br>

The Iris dataset is comprised of 150 samples, and each sample records the width and height of both the petal and sepal. To visualize these samples, two graphs were created: one comparing petal width and height, the other comparing sepal width and height. The following shows these relationships and the categorization of each data point.</br>
